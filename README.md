# cpp20_in_TTs
C++20 features described in Before/After tables ("Tony Tables")

This is an attempt to succinctly describe the main (not all) features of C++20, and to update these docs as features are moved through the committee.

See the list of files in the repo â€” typically one file per feature (hopefully obvious via the file name).
Once C++20 is finalizing, we can put it all together into a single doc.

Many of the examples come directly from the original committee proposals (particularly since we started asking for TTs and/or clear examples in the proposals!), so thanks to the proposal authors.

And thanks to [eracpp](https://github.com/eracpp) for a number of contributions!
