# cpp20_in_TTs
C++20 features described in Before/After tables ("Tony Tables")

This is an attempt to succinctly describe the main (not all) features of C++20, and to update these docs as features are moved through the committee.

See the list of files in the repo - typically one file per feature (hopefully obvious via the file name).
Once C++20 is finalizing, we can put it all together into a single doc.
